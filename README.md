# Wildlife-Intrusion-Detection and Repulsion System
 -A Predictive model to recognize animal intrusion  through computer vision
 
 Methodology:IR Sensors kept along the borders of the plot detects presence of animals in a range upto 15 metres and thus switching on the cameras
 Captured Pictures are analysed through machine learning and the system identifies the animal.It then switches on Ultrasonic sound sensor that produces sound in frequency range  16,000 Hz to 23,000 Hz (cannot be heard by humans).This sound causes irritation to animals and thus they are repelled away from the crop.An alert message  is also sent to the respective owner
